First extract the compressed files, the following folders will be generated:
db_txt_files (for testing)
movies_reviews (for training)
testing (also for testing with less number of files)

Then run the evaluate.py file: python evaluate.py > results.txt
Now it trains the system using improved version of Bayes classifier and then test the whole documents.
